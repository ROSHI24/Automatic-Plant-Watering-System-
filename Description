As part of my Electrical and Electronics Engineering course, I worked on a team project to design and implement an Automatic Plant Watering System using Arduino Uno and a soil moisture sensor.
The system monitors soil moisture levels in real time and automatically controls a relay-driven water pump. When the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, the pump is activated to irrigate the plant. Once adequate moisture is reached, the system switches the pump off, ensuring efficient water usage and preventing overwatering.
This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems and automation in sustainable irrigation, making it suitable for home gardens, and small-scale agricultural use.

Technologies & Components Used:
Arduino Uno, Soil Moisture Sensor, 5V Relay Module, Mini Submersible Water Pump, 9V Battery, Jumper Wires

My Role & Learnings:
I worked on Arduino, relay control, and understanding real-time automation based on sensor data. The project strengthened my fundamentals in embedded systems, hardware-software integration, and sustainable engineering solutions.
